# Dungeon-Crawler
Created a simple 2d game where when given an input of a dungeon map, the user is able to control a player model to move around the dungeon and interact with doors, amulets, treasure chest etc.

The maps are labeled easy or hard depending on their complexity and size.

Dungeoncrawler.cpp contains the main function and is where the user is prompted for inputs.

Logic.cpp contains the map reader function by turning the map into a 2d dynamic array. It also has the interaction logic triggered upon user input.

Helper.cpp helps to display the map during the gameplay and also contains the prompts the user will see.

Logic.h constains the constants mapping what each symbol represents in the game.
