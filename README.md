# Dungeon-Crawler
Created a simple 2d game where when given an input of a dungeon map, the user is able to control a player model to move around the dungeon and interact with doors, amulets, treasure chest etc.

The maps are labeled easy or hard depending on their complexity and size.

Dungeoncrawler.cpp contains the main function and is where the user is prompted for inputs.

Logic.cpp constains the map reader function by turning the map into a 2d dynamic array. It also contains all of the interaction logic between the player model and surrounding objects.
